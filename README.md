# XNether mod

Brings PilzAdam's Nether more life: trees, grass, firefly particles. It's just a
decorative mod that makes nether less desert-like.
Trees and grass won't burn; though, grass can be destroyed by liquids, like lava.
Tree parts (wood, leaves) can be used in default crafts - fences, meseposts. 
Fruit is eatable (damages on eat).

Do not use with HybridDog's Nether.
